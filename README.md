---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  


### 1.CSS(Cascading style sheet)
Css is used to style there appearance of website on the web. Thus this project was a good exercise to help me understand how best to style a page. The project also tested my ability to use an external cascading style sheet for the whole project.

### 3.Indentation
This refers to the formatting of HTML and CSS. It is easy to read code that is well formatted and work on it on a later date than it is on one that is not. Thus the project tested my ability to apply this.

### 4.Use of version control
It is important that when collaborating or doing an independent project to be able to track the changes and revert to a previous stable state in case of the local copy being damaged.

### 5.Javascript functions.
To use Javascript functions to control when the logical part of the application is called.

### 6.Control flows and Logical operators


## Technologies used
This project has been written in two programming languages, HTML which is used to create the basic skeleton of the pages and CSS which is used to style it.This languages ore dependent on each other in order for a web page to appear fully backed.
The logical part of the application is created out of javascript, which is used to determine the type of triangle.
